This sample project is a proof-of-concept for isomorphic (universal) Webpack rendering using React.

Features

* React
* React-router
* Redux as Flux
* Isomorphic (universal) rendering
* Webpack
* Development mode: hot reload for React components, hot reload for Redux reducers

Quick Start
===========

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
* wait for it to finish (it will say "Now go to http://127.0.0.1:3000" in the end)
* go to `http://localhost:3000`
* interact with the development version of the web application
* `Ctrl + C`
* `npm run production`
* wait a bit for Webpack to finish the build (green stats will appear in the terminal, plus some `node.js` server running commands)
* go to `http://localhost:3000`
* interact with the production version of the web application
